# Normalblog
A normal blog to learn Git. This is the first project for the GitHub account of Angello Nunez. It was created using WSL and Git. The main example was made with HTML and CSS.

> **Git** is essential to be a professional web developer. Learn about version control in Git is something incredibly useful. I can make a lot of things with this knowledge. By the way, I love **GitHub**.

## What is Normalblog?
It is just a normal blog. Another repository for GitHub. This is an example of what you can do with Git. HTML and CSS are just a plus.

* This project has three branches: the main branch, where the final product is ready; the header branch, where the header details were done; and the footer branch, where the footer was completed.

* This is just a funny and easy project.
